## What Is a Bollinger Band?
Bollinger Bands were developed and copyrighted by famous technical trader John Bollinger, designed to discover opportunities that give investors a higher probability of properly identifying when an asset is oversold or overbought.
## Key details
There are three lines that compose Bollinger Bands
A simple moving average (i.e middle band) and an upper and lower band
The upper and lower bands are typically 2 standard deviations +/- from a 20-day SMA (simple moving average)
